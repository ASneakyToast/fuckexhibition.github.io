    <h2>Local Organizations</h2>
    <p>San Francisco has one of the richest histories of queer activism, which is a legacy we are lucky to inherit. To ground our exhibition within our immediate community, we felt it was important to highlight local, San Francisco-based LGBTQ+ resources and institutions. Spanning queer-run art galleries focusing in queer and underrepresented artists to grassroots development organizations catering to the queer and trans AAPI communities, we hope to spotlight a brief but diverse group of organizations within our own communities.</p>
