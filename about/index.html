    <h2 class="astro-KH7BTL4R">Overview</h2>
    <p class="astro-KH7BTL4R">Sex culture as a thematic subject in contemporary art feels like something more intuitive than articulated. In the queer context, elements of sexuality, kink, fetish, and sexual experience are embedded with a tone of simultaneous rawness, honesty, and humor. Radical spaces for sex, sexual expression, and sexual experience where these elements materialize are innate to, and often considered inseparable from, the queer experience. F*CK! presents radically queer sexual experiences from multiple positions, juxtaposing a historical, documentary representation through ephemera of San Francisco’s LGBTQ+ scene, alongside a contemporary fine arts expression of queer kink culture and sexual experience.</p>
    <p class="astro-KH7BTL4R">F*CK! explores the visual aesthetics and experiences of sex, sexuality, and kink in all its pleasure, joy, and humor. The work of Chrissa Chorvat (MFA '24) prods the relationship between pleasure and pain, articulating the abject complexities of desire across various mediums including borosilicate glass, print, and multimedia sculpture. The ephemera,  such as fliers for queer nightlife, provided by  Auto Erotica, a shop located in the historic Castro district specializing in LGBTQ+ objects and memorabilia, represent materialized traces of the queer experience of San Francisco’s leather and S&M cultures. By examining these themes across material forms, F*CK! unapologetically presents a glimpse into the vibrancy of sex, pleasure, kink, sexuality, intimacy, and community-building that exists in the queer community.</p>

    <article class="sf-block astro-KH7BTL4R">
      <h3 class="astro-KH7BTL4R">Chrissa Chorvat (she/they)</h3>
      <p class="astro-KH7BTL4R">is an interdisciplinary artist and MFA student working across disciplines exploring the abject nature of sex, gender, and sexuality through a critical lens. She is a pioneer in the medium of borosilicate glass, developing foundational techniques. Her transition from glass to fine arts generated compositions with a tone combining absurdist humor, celebration, and subjective honesty. Chorvat seeks to physically embody the acts, topics, and sensations often considered taboo in cishetero-normative society. Her thematic foci shift between pain, pleasure, absurdity, and the gray areas in-between, producing a holistic discourse on sex, gender, and sexuality as abject subjects.</p>
